Alfred Workflows
===============

Applescript based Alfred workflows, mostly derived from [scripts I have created](https://github.com/unforswearing/applescript).    


###Available

∫∫ **Clipboard Text Processing** - Simple `bash` commands to speed up note taking. Add quotes or parenthesis, remove spaces, create a slug, convert to upper/lower/title case and title case with no spaces. 

∫∫ **Dued** -  Formatted dates for plain text notes/documents/where ever you need them. [Explanation here](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued). 

∫∫ **Get Current Time** - Take a peek at the time when using a full screen application by typing `timee`. Avoids the (rather ugly) drop down menu bar. 

∫∫ **Hide App Windows** - Hide all application windows using the keyword `hidewin`. Type `hidewin all` to hide all application windows and close Finder windows.  

∫∫ **Markdown Links** - Generate markdown formatted links from urls on your clipboard. [Explanation here](https://github.com/unforswearing/alfredWorkflows/blob/master/help/MDLinksHelp.md).   

∫∫ **Screensaver Password Toggle** - Use `pass on` to turn your password on, and `pass off` to turn it off.
