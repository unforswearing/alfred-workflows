Alfred Workflows
===============

Applescript based Alfred workflows, mostly derived from [scripts I have created](https://github.com/unforswearing/applescript).    


###Available Workflows  

**dued** Formatted dates for plain text notes/documents/where ever you need them. [Explanation here](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued). 

**Hide App Windows** hides all application windows (except Finder) using the keyword `hidewin`. 

**Markdown Links** generates markdown formatted links from urls on your clipboard. [Explanation here](https://github.com/unforswearing/alfredWorkflows/blob/master/help/MDLinksHelp.md).   

**Screensaver Password Toggle**. Use `pass on` to turn your password on, and `pass off` to turn it off.
