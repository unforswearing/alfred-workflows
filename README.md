Alfred Workflows
===============

Applescript based Alfred workflows, derived from [scripts I have created](https://github.com/unforswearing/applescript):  


**dued** [is explained here](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued) 

**Hide App Windows** hides all application windows (except Finder) using the keyword `hidewin`. 

**Markdown Links** generates markdown formatted links from urls on your clipboard. [Explanation here](https://github.com/unforswearing/alfredWorkflows/blob/master/help/MDLinksHelp.md).   

**Screensaver Password Toggle** allows you to turn your "password on wake" settings on (using keyword `ponn`) or off (using keyword `poff`). Update to simplify the keywords coming soon.
